## The Yelp Dataset - A graphical Analysis


### Final Project Data 620
> I use the graphs and some of the tools we have learned through social network analysis to discover some relationships in the Yelp Dataset.
I  utilize the Yelp Open dataset (https://www.yelp.com/dataset/), to understand trends in the food industry and users who utilize yelp to provide reviews and feedback. The goal of the analysis is to understand for a major urban area, focusing on the food industry and restuarants in particular: What are the relationships between users who provide reviews and the businesses that they review?  


#### 1. Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of a data subset provided for research by Yelp. The dataset consists of various business and user attributes and photos uploaded by businesses and users. For this project I only utilize the businesses and user attributes to the conduct the analysis. The business and user attributes consist of the following key attributes: 

> Information on Businesses:

There is information on businesses, such as the number of reviews, locations, the type of business and other attributes like the type of cusines offered at the restuarant.

#### 7. Next Steps

The are a number of steps that can be taken here that can further improve the recommendations generated, and this analysis is quite simple in its approach. 
- Incorporate additional information into the similarlity calculation. Here we only use the ratings, however, we can use / consider information on movie geners and some of the tags that these movie raters have developed
- Consider additional metrics for the ratings similarity calculation including the use of the baseline predictor
